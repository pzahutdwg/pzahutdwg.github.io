                    Get to School 5 is a game where you need to get to school. Many things might stop you along the way
                    though. Maybe you will get trapped in a dungeon, or maybe you will get lost in a forest! Before you
                    go to school, there are many fun things to do around town. You could go fishing, cook food, or maybe
                    even rob a store!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe you will get to school eventually. Why don't you play and find out? If you are stuck, check
                    out the game guide to help you out. This game was made using RPG maker MZ. I made it for a school
                    project.
