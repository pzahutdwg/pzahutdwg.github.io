                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a programmer. I like programming a lot. I know several computer languages including Python and
                    Javascript. I do lots of things aside from gaming and programming though. (Unlike some people) I
                    actually go outside and enjoy life. I do NOT watch anime like a lot of the guys that do what I do.
                    I like to play sports and go for hikes.
                </p>

                    Along with programming, I do photography. I love taking photos! I expecially like photos of nature.
                    I like to listen to music a lot, and I play guitar. I prefer rock music over singer / songwriter,
                    and I dont like country very much. Even though I odn't like country music, I love to be in the
                    country. it is so calming!

                    stunning places ever!</p>
